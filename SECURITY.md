## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, we ask that you do it responsibly.

Please do not make any report public until we have had a chance to review and if necessary, mitigate the risk.

Security reports should be sent to security@nativecli.com.

When reporting a vulnerability, we ask that you provide as much information as possible and if applicable, please submit your PoC with it.

All security reports will be responded to within 48 hours.

All verified security reports which result in making the project safer for everyone will entitle you to have your name/organisation listed against the release with a thank you.
